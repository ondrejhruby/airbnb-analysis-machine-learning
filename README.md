## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to analyze Airbnb listings data to identify key factors that influence prices and availability, and to build predictive models that can provide actionable insights. This project demonstrates a complete machine learning pipeline, including data cleaning, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

## Dataset
- The dataset used in this project comes from **Kaggle** and contains real Airbnb listings data.
- The data includes various features such as location, price, availability, number of reviews, and various amenities.

## Techniques Used
- **End-to-End Machine Learning Workflow**: From data preprocessing to model evaluation.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Data visualization, correlation analysis, feature engineering, and outlier detection.
- **Model Training**: Includes linear regression and other predictive models.
- **Optimization and Hyperparameter Tuning**: Using techniques like cross-validation to improve model performance.
- **Model Explainability and Interpretability**: Detailed interpretation of model coefficients, feature importance, and statistical significance of predictors.

## Modeling Approach
- The project employs a regression approach to predict prices based on various features extracted from the dataset.
- Features were carefully selected, scaled, and transformed to optimize model performance.
- Detailed model evaluation metrics, such as mean absolute error and R-squared, were used to assess performance.
